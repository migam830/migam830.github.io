This is the code for my website / blog. It is made with Jekyll and hosted with GitHub pages. The site used the default Minima theme with only a few customisations.

Files licensed differently will either mention the license at the beginning of the file or have another file in the same directory called `license-[filename].txt` (or both). Here, `[filename]` refers to the name of the file minus the extension e.g. `example.markdown` would have a license file called `license-example.txt`.
