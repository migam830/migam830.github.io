This is the code for my website / blog. It is made with Jekyll and hosted with GitHub pages. The site used the default Minima theme with only a few customisations.

Unless otherwise stated, all files in this repository are All Rights Reserved.

Files licensed differently will either mention the license in the file or have another file in the same directory called `[filename]-license.txt` (or both). Here, `[filename]` refers to the name of the file minus the extension e.g. `example.markdown` would have a license file called `example-license.txt`. License files with a different name format will be explained where they are used.
