title: You shouldn't have to read the small print
---
You've probably heard the expression "read the small print" before. It refers to making sure you read any terms or restrictions in something you are agreeing to. This expression implies that if whoever wrote the agreement tries to screw you over in the future, it's entirely your fault. It implies that to avoid getting screwed, you need to spend several hours of your time carefully scrutinising a dense legal document written deliberately to be as hard to understand as possible.

Obviously, there are times in life where you would want to carefully read a legal document, especially if the legal document is about an important life decision. However, if the document is the terms and conditions to a streaming service, for example, then obviously you aren't going to want to spend a lot of time reading the terms.

Why then, is it seen as normal for a company to include things in their terms and conditions that you would never agree to if they were on the front page? More importantly, why is it legal for companies to include such terms? Obviously, the answer to both of those questions is very complex, and I am definitely not qualified to answer them, but in this post, I want to outline what the problem is, and what you can do to make things at least a bit better.

# Just read the terms if you're so concerned about them! Stop complaining!
As a university student, my time is not very valuable. I happily spend many hours configuring my Linux computer and not changing anything meaningful. I spend many hours watching YouTube videos that don't substantially contribute to my knowledge. I would happily spend several hours reading the terms of a company's service if I wanted to.

However, most people's time is much more valuable than mine. People have important things to do. People have lives. Some people work long hours at jobs so they can earn enough money to cover essential living costs. Would it really be fair for those people to have to read long legal documents if they want to watch a movie in their free time?

Small print allows companies to get away with many problematic things because their terms of service allow them to do so. The problem is the existence of those terms, not people's unwillingness to read them.

# What do these terms of service have that's so concerning?
A lot of things, here are just some examples.

# Taking away your ownership
When you see the word "purchase", you would probably assume that you are acquiring ownership of something in exchange for money. However, the terms of many companies redefine this common English word to take away your ownership. For example, many companies say that the content you 'purchase' from them is licensed and not sold (e.g. Amazon Kindle, Steam). This means the company can take away that content from you if they feel like it.

That's right, many companies will sell you revocable licenses to content and still have the audacity to say it is a purchase!

If you saw the word 'license' instead of 'purchase' when you next went to buy a movie, e-book or video game, would you still buy it? There is no right or wrong answer, but importantly, you should be given that information so you can make an informed decision without reading several pages of legalese.

# Arbitration clauses
**I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice**

Simply thinking about the idea of arbitration clauses for too long makes my blood boil. This is when a company includes a clause in their terms of service that says you cannot file a lawsuit against them and take them to court. Instead, any disputes you and the company have are settled in a process known as arbitration.

Arbitration is a legal process involving a neutral third party who makes a legally binding decision. Doesn't seem so bad, so what's the problem?

Firstly, I'd like to make it clear that arbitration doesn't mean no one will hear your case. Your case will be heard by an arbitrator, often a retired judge, and you can still win against a company in arbitration. The problem with arbitration is that it is a private process (court cases are public) which means your case can't set a precedent. So if you win against a company in arbitration, other people won't be able to use your case as an example if they are trying to resolve the same problem. This means companies can't be held accountable as easily. It's also much harder to appeal a case in arbitration.

The main issue I have with arbitration clauses is that arbitration is supposed to be a mutually consensual process, where both parties agree to arbitration. Despite this, clicking 'accept' on the terms of service of a company is apparently sufficient to count as consent to waive your right to a judge-jury trial. Would you still click 'accept' if you knew this?

Arbitration clauses are common in the US since the Federal Arbitration Act allows them. I am not sure whether or not they are legal in the UK, but I haven't seen any UK-only companies use them.

When asked to accept terms of service, especially in the US, I would recommend you `CTRL+F` search for 'arbitration' in the terms and if the company has an arbitration clause, try to find an alternative company if possible (often it won't be possible).
