Here are some links to stuff on the internet that I like.

# General stuff:
* [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) - legendary web comic, worth checking out if you haven't seen it already
* [neal.fun](https://neal.fun/) - home of The Password Game, Infinite Craft and other random fun stuff, worth checking every couple of months or so
* [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) - large collection of free, public domain e-books, especially useful if you want to read older books on an e-reader
* [YouTube Frame Timer](https://retime.mcbe.wtf/) - useful website for timing speedruns from YouTube videos without downloading any software
* [Consumer Action Taskforce](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/) - wiki fighting consumer exploitation, quite new but very useful

# Linux and open source related:
* [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) - among the best Linux documentation you can find online, useful even if you don't use Arch specifically
* [tldr pages](https://tldr.sh/) - simplified manual pages focusing on practical examples instead of documenting every possible option, extremely useful
* [It's FOSS News](https://news.itsfoss.com/) and [OMG! Ubuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/) - great sites for news about Linux and open source software
* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) - Android app store for open source apps, it's my go to source for Android apps
