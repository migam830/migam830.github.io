Hi, I'm Misha, a first year undergraduate university student studying computer science.

Things I like:
* Linux
* Free software ([as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html))
* Ethical hacking and CTF competitions
* Rubik's cubes and other puzzles
* The [right to repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) movement

Things I don't like:
* [Digital Rights Management](https://www.eff.org/issues/drm)
* [Arbitration clauses](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/wiki/Forced_arbitration) in terms of service
* Overuse of AI (I enjoy being able to think about things instead of letting the computer think for me)

The content on this blog is 100% human made. No AI tools are used.
