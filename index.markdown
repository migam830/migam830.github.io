Hi, I'm Misha, a first year undergraduate university student studying computer science.

I like:
* Linux
* Free software ([as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html))
* Ethical hacking and CTF competitions
* Rubik's cubes and other puzzles
* The [right to repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) movement
* Biscuits (the British version)

I don't like:
* Microsoft Windows
* Anything made by Apple
* Nintendo's legal department
* [Digital Rights Management](https://www.eff.org/issues/drm)
* [Arbitration clauses](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/wiki/Forced_arbitration) in terms of service
* When websites make you pay to reject cookies
* When people use LLMs instead of thinking for themselves
* People who try to sue someone for pressing F12 ([yes, really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSsvzBV0tyI))

My posts are 100% human made. No AI tools used.
